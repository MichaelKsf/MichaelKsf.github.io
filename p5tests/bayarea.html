            <p> <img src="p5testimages/sales_force_tower.jpg" alt="Salesforce Tower" class="floatleft"> Perhaps the most contentious topic among locals: the Salesforce Tower. It's now risen above the skyline, and as far as I can tell, visable from anywhere I am in the Bay Area. Everytime I look up, there it is.</p>
            
            <p>Fireworks in SF are a rare sighting - usually they're just colored fog - people stand around and ooh and aah at the pretty colors. This year, for New Year's Eve down along the Embarcadero, the view was quite clear and the now permanent light installation on the Bay Bridge made for a nice setting.</p>

            <p>It's almost impossible to separtate these two topics at this point, from my perspective. San Francisco has been a city of great wealth and resources even back to the Gold Rush days, but there was always a compassionate spirit to the people who held the resources. For the most part people were looked after.</p>

            <p>With the recent passing of Mayor Lee, there's a concerted effort to find effective leadship on the issue that has been tented over San Francisco for almost a decade now.</p>

            <h4>Bio:</h4>

            <p>Formed as a trio in the <em>mid 2000s</em>, Caravan Palace is a French gypsy swing band started and based in <strong>Paris, France</strong>. Their influcences range from the old-school days of 30s and 40s swing artists all the way to current electronica and hip-hop bazaar sounds.</p>

            <p>Consisting of strings at first; a guitar, double bass and violin; they’ve expanded to include woodwinds, keyboards and vocals (and more!), all jazzed up with a funkadelic swing. Their first release, "Joile Coquine," garnered a lot of attention and they were soon touring Europe and booked a recording studio. Things really swung in 2007 when they find themselves in the <strong>Django Reinhardt Festival</strong> in Samois, France.</p>
    
            <p>To date, Caravan Palace has released 3 full length albums. The self titled "Caravan Palace" in 2008, followed by "Panic" in 2012 and their most recent album which is simply known by it’s textface: <samp><|°_°|></samp> (i.e.: robot face...which really messes with HTML programming!!!)</samp></p>
    
            <p>The current roster for the band includes 7 musicians playing and programming everything from a guitar to keyboards to a bari saxophone.  They toured the eastern US in 2017 and it would be awesome if they ever came to the west coast, I’d get tickets in a heartbeat.</p>

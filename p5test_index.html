            <p>Home is where the heart is and San Francisco has been my home for over 20 years. As someone once told me: grow where you're planted. That certainly has been the case for me. Enjoy the look around!</p>

            <p>Having fun seeing what my new camera could do, I dressed up as a tourist and took photos around my neighborhood. This one group had dressed up as Smurfs...sexy AF, and I was mistified how the managed to not get a speck of blue body paint on their white pants.<p>

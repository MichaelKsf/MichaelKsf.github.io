               <h2>Dolores Park</h2>
            
                    <p> <img src="p5testimages/man_reading_book.jpg" class="floatleft"> On a sunny day there's hardly a better place to be in the city than Dolores Park. Sometimes lovingly referred to as the City's back yard, or at least for the Mission and Castro neighborhoods, the park is usually packed with people. One time we were driving back from South City and topped the hill at 19th. It was Pink Saturday, the day before Gay Pride in San Francisco. The park had just undergone a mulit-million dollar renovation and had been closed for far too long.</p>
            
                    <p><img src="p5testimages/torso_calvin_waistband.jpg" class="floatleft">There wasn't a spot of green grass to be seen. It was solid flesh, blankets and festivities.</p>

        <h2>City Hall</h2>
        
       <aside>
             
            <p>On any given night, SF's City Hall may be lit up in any number of combinations of colors. Many are obvious, rainbow for Gay Pride, Blue for the Warriors, Orange for the Giants, red & green for Christmas and so on.</p>
            
            <img src="p5testimages/SF_City_Hall_purple.jpg" alt="SF City Hall" >
            
            <p>Then there are nights when the Beaux Arts building glows in a color that surely means something to someone, like purple,  or blue and green and others. It would be great if City Hall had it's own Instagram feed to let us know what's going on.</p>
            
            <p>Also, a little know fact about City Hall: on average there are 3 weddings every 1/2 hour in the building.</p>

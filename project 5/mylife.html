            <h2>Harvey Milk Civil Rights Academy</h2>
            
            <p>One day a week I get to volunteer in a 4th and 5th grade classroom at Harvey Milk Civil Rights Academy in the Castro (photo above). My friend George has been volunteering there for almost 20 years and roped me into helping me with a project last year. I went into the classrooms with other members of the community and we did education and awarness work about the Castro. I met some of the teachers, and was encouraged to go thru the clearance process and become a regular volunteer.</p>
            <p>The program is overseen by the San Francisco Ed Fund, a local non-profit which coordinates 1000s of volunteer hours in SFUSD. After the training, background check, TB test and fingerprinting, I was finally cleared to become a general classroom assistant. Ironically, I spend most of my time tutoring students on their math...which is admittedly NOT my strong suit.</p>

                <p>Band geek. That was me in high school. Then I dropped it when I went to college. But, for some reason, I didn't get rid of my saxophone. Probably because my parents spent a lot on it at the time when I was in 6th grade and it was a very complicated piece of machinery with all of it's levers, springs and pads. --Anyway, it had been over 20 years since I had played. I would watch the Gay Pride Parade and watch the band go by and think - I can do that. I just didn't know how to get involved. Then one day I saw a photo of a friend of mine who was marching with the band in the Chinese New Year's parade. I reached out to him and asked him how it worked.</p>
                
                <p>"Just show up."</p>
                
                <p>That's what he said and that's what I did. This is my 5th season with the band. It's like a family for me. And definately a lot of fun marching down the street covered in feathered rainbow plumes.</p>

                <p>And, each spring, we play for the Hayward Gay Prom - a tradition that started years ago when protesters would yell homophobic comments at the youth. The band was invited to drown them out. It's been years since the protestors have shown up, but the band comes anyway - to welcome the couples and groups having their Prom experience. It's one of my favorite gigs.</p>
